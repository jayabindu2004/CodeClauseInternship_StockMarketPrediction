# CodeClauseInternship_StockMarketPrediction
This is my second data science project as part of my CodeClause internship. This project involves using data science technique, that is, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to predict stock market prices. The goal is to create an accurate model for stock price prediction and provide visualizations and reports on its performance.
